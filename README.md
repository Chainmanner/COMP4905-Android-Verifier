# COMP4905-Android-Verifier
A program and recovery image that are used to verify an Android installation on a bootloader-unlocked phone. Done as part of my Honours Project.

NOTE: The files under `recovery/bootloader_message/`, `recovery/minui/`, `recovery/recovery_ui/` and `recovery/res-xhdpi/` are from the Android Open Source Project, which uses the Apache 2.0 License. Every other file is made by me, and is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

TODO: Describe this and add the GNU GPLv3 header to all of my files.
